# Accessibility Statement

## Public body

Senate Department for Labour, Social Services, Gender Equality, Integration, Diversity and Anti-Discrimination

We endeavour to make our website accessible. The declaration on digital accessibility is required by the Berlin Act on Accessible Information and Communication Technology (BIKTG Bln). The technical requirements for accessibility are set out in the current Barrier-free Information Technology Ordinance (BITV).

This accessibility statement (as of 18 November 2024) refers to the subdomain fairgnuegen.berlin.de. It does not apply to other pages on berlin.de to which other accessibility statements apply. This application is operated by Technologiestiftung Berlin (more about the project). All other content is technically operated by BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH & Co. KG.

## How accessible is the website?

This website/application is only partially accessible. It only partially fulfils the requirements of the current BITV.

## Which areas are not accessible?

The areas listed below are not accessible for the following reasons:

### Barrier: Minimum contrast not sufficient
- Description: Graphic control elements and information-bearing graphic elements do not always maintain the minimum contrast and can therefore be difficult to perceive in some cases.
- Measures: Increase the contrast of the affected elements
- Timeline: to be fixed in 2025

### Barrier: Link text not clearly distinguishable
- Description: Links are not always distinguished from the surrounding text in a way that is not based on colour.
- Measures: Underline link texts
- Timeline: to be fixed in 2025
 
### Barrier: Restriction in the operation of elements 
- Description: Some operating elements do not have the necessary roles, names, status information and associated control concepts, which restricts the operation of these elements.
- Measures: Add control concepts for operating elements
- Timeline: to be fixed in 2025

We are working on improving the accessibility of this application.
